The goal of the book is to explain the concept of social media analytics and demonstrate its applications using Python. We use Python 3 for the different concepts and projects in the book. You will need a Linux/macOS or Windows machine with Python 3 and an IDE of your choice (Sublime Text 2, Atom, or gedit). All the libraries presented in the chapters can be easily installed with pip package manager. It is advisable to use the Python library Jupyter to work in notebook mode.
